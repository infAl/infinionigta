To install this mod, you need to have Simple Mod Loader installed first.

You can download Simple Mod Loader from github:
https://github.com/infal/modloader/releases


Once you have Simple Mod Loader installed, extract the contents of this zip file to the avorion/data/scripts/mods/ folder. (If the mods folder doesn't exist, just make one)

Now when you start the game, when you're in a ship (not the drone) you will see the Cargo UI icon at the top right automatically.
